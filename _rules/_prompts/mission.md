# Mission: Build a shared devlog session history system.

The Devlog Beads project forks the Beads issue tracker into a graph-powered development session memory system that imports existing markdown devlogs (index.md + dated session files), automatically extracts software entities from problem descriptions, builds architectural dependency graphs between components/modal/hooks/endpoints, and enables hybrid text+graph retrieval to resume debugging with complete session history and related-context discovery across multi-session fixes/features/enhancements.
