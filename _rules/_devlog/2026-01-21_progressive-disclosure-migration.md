# Comprehensive Development Log: Migrate Agent Instructions to Progressive Disclosure

**Date:** 2026-01-21

### **Objective:**
To implement the Progressive Disclosure Protocol for agent instructions, separating the "how-to" (protocol) from the "what-is" (project context) to reduce token consumption and improve agent focus.

---

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Architecture**

**Initial Problem:** Agent instruction files (GEMINI.md, AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) were monolithic, loading all context at once, which consumed excessive tokens and diluted focus.

*   **My Assumption/Plan #1:** Split instructions into a "Bootloader" and on-demand reference files.
    *   **Action Taken:** Analyzed the proposed "Progressive Disclosure" strategy involving a hub-and-spoke model.
    *   **Result:** Confirmed feasibility. Defined a new structure:
        - `_rules/_orchestration/` for all protocol files.
        - `PROTOCOL.md` for onboarding.
        - `WORKING_PROTOCOL.md` for the daily loop.
        - `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the migrated legacy content.

---

### **Phase 2: Implementation (Manual Migration)**

**Initial Problem:** Need to apply this structure to the current repository as a Proof of Concept (POC) before automating it in the CLI.

*   **My Assumption/Plan #1:** Create the file structure manually and move content.
    *   **Action Taken:**
        1. Created `_rules/_orchestration/`.
        2. Created `PROTOCOL.md`, `WORKING_PROTOCOL.md`, `BEADS_REFERENCE.md`, `DEVLOG_REFERENCE.md`.
        3. Extracted legacy content from `GEMINI.md` (excluding the old protocol block) into `_rules/_orchestration/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
        4. Overwrote `GEMINI.md` and `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with the new lightweight "Bootloader".
    *   **Result:** Success. The repository now uses the Progressive Disclosure structure. Agents starting here will see the lightweight bootloader first.

### **Phase 3: CLI Automation**

**Initial Problem:** Need to automate the scaffolding and migration for all new projects.

*   **My Assumption/Plan #1:** Integrate logic into `bd init` and `bd onboard`.
    *   **Action Taken:**
        1. Created `cmd/bd/init_orchestration.go` for scaffolding.
        2. Created `cmd/bd/init_templates.go` for markdown context templates (using `[codeblock=bash]` placeholders to avoid Go syntax issues).
        3. Created `cmd/bd/init_helpers.go` to keep templates clean.
        4. Updated `cmd/bd/init.go` to call `initializeOrchestration`.
        5. Updated `cmd/bd/onboard.go` to handle the content migration to `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
        6. Updated `_rules/AGENTS.md.protocol` as the source of truth for the bootloader.
    *   **Result:** Success. Build passed, sandbox tests verified migration of legacy content and bootloader installation.

---

### **Phase 6: Fix Initialization Order**

**Initial Problem:** `bd init --quiet` was skipping orchestration and devlog initialization because the calls were placed after an early return for quiet mode.

*   **My Assumption/Plan #1:** Move critical initialization logic before the UI-only quiet check.
    *   **Action Taken:** Moved `initializeOrchestration` and `initializeDevlog` before the `if quiet { return }` block in `cmd/bd/init.go`.
    *   **Result:** Success. Verified that `devlog_dir` is correctly saved to the database in both verbose and quiet modes.

---

### **Final Session Summary**

**Final Status:** Progressive Disclosure Protocol is fully automated, refined, and verified across all initialization modes.
**Key Learnings:**
*   Side-effects that affect permanent state (like updating a database) must be decoupled from UI-related early returns.
*   "Quiet mode" should only suppress output, not essential configuration logic.

### **Architectural Relationships**
<!-- Format: [From Entity] -> [To Entity] (relationship type) -->
- bd init -> initializeOrchestration (ensured in all modes)
- bd init -> initializeDevlog (ensured in all modes)
- bd onboard -> PROTOCOL.md (prompts to read)
- devlog search -> bd devlog sync (suggests on empty results)
