// Package sqlite provides the blocked_issues_cache optimization for GetReadyWork performance.
//
// # Performance Impact
//
// GetReadyWork originally used a recursive CTE to compute blocked issues on every query,
// taking ~752ms on a 10K issue database. With the cache, queries complete in ~29ms
// (25x speedup) by using a simple NOT EXISTS check against the materialized cache table.
//
// # Cache Architecture
//
// The blocked_issues_cache table stores issue_id values for all issues that are currently
// blocked. An issue is blocked if:
//   - It has a 'blocks' dependency on an open/in_progress/blocked issue (direct blocking)
//   - It has a 'blocks' dependency on an external:* reference (cross-project blocking, bd-om4a)
//   - It has a 'conditional-blocks' dependency where the blocker hasn't failed (bd-kzda)
//   - It has a 'waits-for' dependency on a spawner with unclosed children (bd-xo1o.2)
//   - Its parent is blocked and it's connected via 'parent-child' dependency (transitive blocking)
//
// WaitsFor gates (bd-xo1o.2): B waits for spawner A's dynamically-bonded children.
// Gate types: "all-children" (default, blocked until ALL close) or "any-children" (until ANY closes).
//
// Conditional blocks (bd-kzda): B runs only if A fails. B is blocked until A is closed
// with a failure close reason (failed, rejected, wontfix, canceled, abandoned, etc.).
// If A succeeds (closed without failure), B stays blocked.
//
// The cache is maintained automatically by invalidating and rebuilding whenever:
//   - A 'blocks', 'conditional-blocks', 'waits-for', or 'parent-child' dependency is added or removed
//   - Any issue's status changes (affects whether it blocks others)
//   - An issue is closed (closed issues don't block others; conditional-blocks checks close_reason)
//
// Related and discovered-from dependencies do NOT trigger cache invalidation since they
// don't affect blocking semantics.
//
// # Cache Invalidation Strategy
//
// On any triggering change, the entire cache is rebuilt from scratch (DELETE + INSERT).
// This full-rebuild approach is chosen because:
//   - Rebuild is fast (<50ms even on 10K databases) due to optimized CTE logic
//   - Simpler implementation than incremental updates
//   - Dependency changes are rare compared to reads
//   - Guarantees consistency - no risk of partial/stale updates
//
// The rebuild happens within the same transaction as the triggering change, ensuring
// atomicity and consistency. The cache can never be in an inconsistent state visible
// to queries.
//
// # Transaction Safety
//
// All cache operations support both transaction and direct database execution:
//   - rebuildBlockedCache accepts optional *sql.Tx parameter
//   - If tx != nil, uses transaction; otherwise uses direct db connection
//   - Cache invalidation during CreateIssue/UpdateIssue/AddDependency happens in their tx
//   - Ensures cache is always consistent with the database state
//
// # Performance Characteristics
//
// Query performance (GetReadyWork):
//   - Before cache: ~752ms (recursive CTE on 10K issues)
//   - With cache: ~29ms (NOT EXISTS check)
//   - Speedup: 25x
//
// Write overhead:
//   - Cache rebuild: <50ms (full DELETE + INSERT)
//   - Only triggered on dependency/status changes (rare operations)
//   - Trade-off: slower writes for much faster reads
//
// # Edge Cases Handled
//
// 1. Parent-child transitive blocking:
//    - Children of blocked parents are automatically marked as blocked
//    - Propagates through arbitrary depth hierarchies (limited to depth 50)
//
// 2. Multiple blockers:
//    - Issue blocked by multiple open issues stays blocked until all are closed
//    - DISTINCT in CTE ensures issue appears once in cache
//
// 3. Status changes:
//    - Closing a blocker removes all blocked descendants from cache
//    - Reopening a blocker adds them back
//
// 4. Dependency removal:
//    - Removing last blocker unblocks the issue
//    - Removing parent-child link unblocks orphaned subtree
//
// 5. Foreign key cascades:
//    - Cache entries automatically deleted when issue is deleted (ON DELETE CASCADE)
//    - No manual cleanup needed
//
// # Future Optimizations
//
// If rebuild becomes a bottleneck in very large databases (>100K issues):
//   - Consider incremental updates for specific dependency types
//   - Add indexes to dependencies table for CTE performance
//   - Implement dirty tracking to avoid rebuilds when cache is unchanged
//
// However, current performance is excellent for realistic workloads.
