# Beads Release Formula v2 (Gate-Aware)
#
# This formula uses gates for async waits during CI, enabling clean phase handoffs.
# Instead of polling, the polecat completes Phase 1, and a gate blocks Phase 2
# until GitHub Actions finishes.
#
# Phases:
#   1. Prep & Push: preflight → push-tag (polecat work)
#   2. Gate: await-ci (async wait for release.yml)
#   3. Verify: verify-github, verify-npm, verify-pypi (parallel)
#   4. Install: local-install → release-complete (fan-in)

Beads release workflow v2 - gate-aware async release.

This formula orchestrates a complete release cycle with async gates:

Phase 1 (Polecat Work):
  1. Preflight checks (clean git, up to date)
  2. Documentation updates (CHANGELOG, info.go)
  3. Version bump (all components)
  4. Git operations (commit, tag, push)

Gate (Async Wait):
  5. await-ci: Gate on GitHub Actions release.yml completion

Phase 2 (Parallel Verification):
  6. Verify GitHub release, npm package, PyPI package (concurrent)

Phase 3 (Installation):
  7. Local installation update
  8. Daemon restart

## Usage

```bash
bd mol wisp create beads-release --var version=0.44.0
```

Or assign to a polecat:
```bash
gt sling beads/polecats/p1 --formula beads-release --var version=0.44.0
```

The polecat will complete Phase 1, then signal phase-complete. The gate blocks
until release.yml finishes. A new polecat (or the same one) resumes for Phases 2-3.

Ensure we're in the correct git directory, especially for worktree setups.

# Check current repo root and remote
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git remote get-url origin

# Verify this is the main worktree (not a linked worktree)
git worktree list
```

For worktree setups, releases should be done from the **main worktree** to ensure:
- Correct file paths in commits
- Proper tag association
- Clean branch history

If you're in a linked worktree:
1. Note the path to the main worktree (first line of `git worktree list`)
2. Switch to that directory before proceeding
3. Or use: `cd $(git worktree list | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)`

**Red flags:**
- Remote URL doesn't match expected repository
- You're in a linked worktree (not the main one)
- `git status` shows different files than expected

**Handling uncommitted changes:**

If changes are in release-related files (CHANGELOG, version files), you may want to:
- Include them in the release commit
- Or stash and apply after version bump

If changes are in **non-release files** (e.g., .beads/config.yaml, .claude/settings.json, local configs):
```bash
# Auto-stash non-release files
git stash push -m "pre-release: non-release changes" -- .beads/ .claude/ *.local* .env*

# Verify working tree is now clean (or only has release files)
git status --short
```

**Important:** The bump script may fail if non-release files are modified. Always stash:
- `.beads/` directory (local config)
- `.claude/` directory (agent settings)
- Any `.local`, `.env`, or personal config files

- "Your branch is ahead" → You have unpushed commits - review before release!
- "Your branch has diverged" → **STOP** - resolve divergence first

```bash
# If branch is behind or even, pull latest
git pull --rebase
```

**Recovering from divergence:**
If your branch has diverged from origin (e.g., after a botched commit):
```bash
# Option 1: Reset to origin (loses local commits)
git reset --hard origin/main

# Option 2: Rebase local commits on top of origin
git rebase origin/main
