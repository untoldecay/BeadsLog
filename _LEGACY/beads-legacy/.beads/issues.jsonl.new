{"id":"bd-627d","title":"AI-supervised database migrations for safer schema evolution","description":"## Problem\n\nDatabase migrations can lose user data through edge cases that are hard to anticipate (e.g., GH #201 where bd migrate failed to set issue_prefix, or bd-d355a07d false positive data loss warnings). Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","notes":"## Progress\n\n### ✅ Phase 1: Migration Invariants (COMPLETED)\n\n**Implemented:**\n- Created internal/storage/sqlite/migration_invariants.go with 3 invariants\n- Updated RunMigrations() to verify invariants after migrations\n- All tests pass ✓\n\n### ✅ Phase 2: Inspection Tools (COMPLETED \u0026 PUSHED)\n\n**Commit:** 1abe4e7 - \"Add migration inspection tools for AI agents (bd-627d Phase 2)\"\n\n**Implemented:**\n1. ✅ bd migrate --inspect --json - Shows migration plan\n2. ✅ bd info --schema --json - Returns schema details\n3. ✅ Migration warnings system\n4. ✅ Documentation updated in AGENTS.md\n5. ✅ All tests pass\n\n### ✅ Phase 3: MCP Tools (COMPLETED \u0026 PUSHED)\n\n**Commit:** 2493693 - \"Add MCP tools for migration inspection (bd-627d Phase 3)\"\n\n**Implemented:**\n1. ✅ inspect_migration(workspace_root) tool in beads-mcp\n2. ✅ get_schema_info(workspace_root) tool in beads-mcp\n3. ✅ Abstract methods in BdClientBase\n4. ✅ CLI client implementations\n5. ✅ All tests pass\n\n**All phases complete!** Migration inspection fully integrated into MCP server.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-02T12:57:10.722048-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T12:12:46.522298-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T14:31:25.095308-08:00"}

Tests Are Not Properly Categorized\nWe have three types of tests mixed together:\n- **Unit tests** - should be fast, test single functions\n- **Integration tests** - test full workflows, need DB/git\n- **End-to-end tests** - test entire CLI commands\n\nThey're all lumped together in cmd/bd, all running every time.\n\n# What We've Already Fixed\n\nAdded `integration` build tags to 16 obviously-slow test files:\n- import_profile_test.go (performance benchmarking tests)\n- export_mtime_test.go (tests with time.Sleep calls)\n- cli_fast_test.go (full CLI integration tests)\n- delete_test.go, import_uncommitted_test.go, sync_local_only_test.go (git integration)\n- And 10 more in internal/ packages\n\nThese are now excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n## Option 1: Shared Test Fixtures (Quick Win)\nCreate a shared test database that multiple tests can use:\n```go\nvar testDB *sqlite.SQLiteStorage\nvar testDBOnce sync.Once\n\nfunc getSharedTestDB(t *testing.T) storage.Storage {\n    testDBOnce.Do(func() {\n        // Create one DB for all tests\n    })\n    return testDB\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, immediate speedup\n**Cons**: Tests become less isolated, harder to debug failures\n\n## Option 2: Table-Driven Tests (Medium Win)\nCollapse similar tests into table-driven tests:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct{\n        name string\n        args []string\n        want string\n    }{\n        {\"basic issue\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\"}, \"created\"},\n        {\"with description\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\", \"-d\", \"desc\"}, \"created\"},\n        // ... 50 more cases\n    }\n    \n    db := setupOnce(t) // Setup once, not 50 times\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            // test using shared db\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Dramatically reduces setup overhead, tests run in parallel\n**Cons**: Requires refactoring, tests share more state\n\n## Option 3: Split cmd/bd Tests Into Packages (Big Win)\nMove tests into focused packages:\n- `cmd/bd/internal/clitests` - CLI integration tests (mark with integration tag)\n- `cmd/bd/internal/unittests` - Fast unit tests\n- Keep only essential tests in cmd/bd\n\n**Pros**: Clean separation, easy to run just fast tests\n**Cons**: Requires significant refactoring\n\n## Option 4: Parallel Execution (Quick Win)\nAdd `t.Parallel()` to independent tests:\n```go\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Run this test concurrently with others\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to add, can cut time in half on multi-core machines\n**Cons**: Doesn't reduce actual test work, just parallelizes it\n\n## Option 5: In-Memory Databases (Medium Win)\nUse `:memory:` SQLite databases instead of file-based:\n```go\nstore, err := sqlite.New(ctx, \":memory:\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Faster than disk I/O, easier cleanup\n**Cons**: Some tests need actual file-based DBs (export/import tests)\n\n# Recommended Approach\n\n**Short-term (this week)**:\n1. Add `t.Parallel()` to all independent tests in cmd/bd\n2. Use `:memory:` databases where possible\n3. Create table-driven tests for similar test cases\n\n**Medium-term (next sprint)**:\n4. Split cmd/bd tests into focused packages\n5. Mark more integration tests appropriately\n\n**Long-term (backlog)**:\n6. Consider shared test fixtures with proper isolation\n\n# Current Status\n\nWe've tagged 16 files with `integration` build tag, but the remaining 279 tests in cmd/bd still take 8+ minutes. This issue tracks fixing the cmd/bd test performance specifically.\n\n# Target\n\nGet `go test ./...` (without `-short` or `-tags=integration`) down to **under 30 seconds**.\n\n\n# THE REAL ROOT CAUSE (Updated Analysis)\n\nAfter examining the actual test code, the problem is clear:\n\n## Every Test Creates Its Own Database From Scratch\n\nLook at `create_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens NEW SQLite connection\n                                                    // ← Runs migrations\n                                                    // ← Sets config\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDescription(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates ANOTHER temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens ANOTHER SQLite connection\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n```\n\n**This happens 279 times!**\n\n## These Tests Don't Need Isolation!\n\nMost tests are just checking:\n- \"Can I create an issue with a title?\"\n- \"Can I create an issue with a description?\"\n- \"Can I add labels?\"\n\nThey don't conflict with each other. They could all share ONE database!\n\n## The Fix: Test Suites with Shared Setup\n\nInstead of:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDesc(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n```\n\nDo this:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    // ONE setup for all subtests\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")\n    \n    t.Run(\"basic_issue\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()  // Can run concurrently - tests don't conflict\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"with_description\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    // ... 50 more subtests, all using same DB\n}\n```\n\n**Result**: 50 tests → 1 database setup instead of 50!\n\n## Why This Works\n\nSQLite is fine with concurrent reads and isolated transactions. These tests:\n- ✅ Create different issues (no ID conflicts)\n- ✅ Just read back what they created\n- ✅ Don't depend on database state from other tests\n\nThey SHOULD share a database!\n\n## Real Numbers\n\nCurrent:\n- 279 tests × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **8 minutes**\n\nAfter fix:\n- 10 test suites × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **30 seconds**\n- 279 subtests running in parallel using those 10 DBs = **5 seconds**\n\n**Total: ~35 seconds instead of 8 minutes!**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Group related tests** into suites (Create, List, Update, Delete, etc.)\n2. **One setup per suite** instead of per test\n3. **Use t.Run() for subtests** with t.Parallel()\n4. **Keep tests that actually need isolation** separate (export/import tests, git operations)\n\nThis is way better than shuffling tests into folders!","notes":"## Progress Update (2025-11-21)\n\n✅ **Completed**:\n- Audited all 280 tests, created TEST_SUITE_AUDIT.md ([deleted:bd-c49])\n- Refactored create_test.go to shared DB pattern ([deleted:bd-y6d])\n- Proven the pattern works: 11 tests now run in 0.04s with 1 DB instead of 11\n\n❌ **Current Reality**:\n- Overall test suite: Still 8+ minutes (no meaningful change)\n- Only 1 of 76 test files refactored\n- Saved ~10 DB initializations out of 280\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (REALISTIC)\n\nThis task is NOT complete until:\n- [ ] All P1 files refactored (create ✅, dep, stale, comments, list, ready)\n- [ ] Test suite runs in \u003c 2 minutes\n- [ ] Measured and verified actual speedup\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

{"id":"bd-srwk","title":"bd export should detect and prevent stale database exports","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen `bd export` is run with a stale database (older than issues.jsonl), it silently overwrites the JSONL file with stale data, causing data loss.\n\n## What Happened (vc project)\n\n1. Agent A created 4 new issues and exported to issues.jsonl (commit 99a9d58)\n2. Agent A closed an issue and exported again (commit 58b4613) - JSONL now has 4 epics\n3. Agent B had stale database (from before step 1)\n4. Agent B worked on unrelated issue and exported (commit 0609233)\n5. Agent B's export **overwrote issues.jsonl**, removing the 4 epics created by Agent A\n6. Required manual recovery by re-exporting from Agent A's correct database\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd export` should detect that the database is stale and either:\n- **Refuse to export** with error message explaining the issue\n- **Warn prominently** and require explicit --force flag to override\n- **Auto-import first** to sync database before exporting\n\n## How to Detect Staleness\n\nCompare modification times (similar to VC's ValidateDatabaseFreshness):\n1. Check .db, .db-wal, .db-shm timestamps (use newest for WAL mode)\n2. Check issues.jsonl timestamp\n3. If JSONL is newer by \u003e1 second: database is stale\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd staleness check in `bd export`:\n\n```go\nfunc Export(dbPath, jsonlPath string, force bool) error {\n    // Check if database is stale\n    if !force {\n        if err := checkDatabaseFreshness(dbPath, jsonlPath); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"database is stale: %w\\n\" +\n                \"Run 'bd import %s' first to sync, or use --force to override\",\n                err, jsonlPath)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with export...\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity**: High (silent data loss)\n- **Frequency**: Happens in multi-agent workflows when agents don't sync\n- **Workaround**: Manual recovery (re-export from correct database)\n\n## References\n\n- VC issue tracker: commits 58b4613 -\u003e 0609233 -\u003e c41c638\n- VC has similar check: `storage.ValidateDatabaseFreshness()`\n- Tolerance: 1 second (handles filesystem timestamp precision)","notes":"Fixed with ID-based comparison instead of just count. Now detects:\n1. DB has fewer issues than JSONL (count check)\n2. DB has different issues than JSONL (ID comparison)\n\nBoth scenarios now properly refuse export unless --force is used.\n\nImplementation uses getIssueIDsFromJSONL() to build a set of IDs from JSONL, then checks if any JSONL IDs are missing from DB.

Users expect 'cleanup' to do comprehensive cleanup.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n1. `bd cleanup --force` → converts closed issues to tombstones\n2. Expired tombstones (\u003e30 days) remain in issues.jsonl\n3. User must separately run `bd compact` to prune tombstones\n4. `bd doctor` warns about expired tombstones: 'Run bd compact to prune'\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd cleanup` should also prune expired tombstones from issues.jsonl.\n\n## Impact\n\nWith v0.30.0 making tombstones the default migration path, this UX gap becomes more visible. Users cleaning up their database shouldn't need to know about a separate `bd compact` command.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCall `pruneExpiredTombstones()` at the end of the cleanup command (same function used by compact). Report results:\n\n```\n✓ Deleted 15 closed issue(s)\n✓ Pruned 3 expired tombstone(s) (older than 30 days)\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `cmd/bd/cleanup.go` - Add call to pruneExpiredTombstones after deleteBatch\n- May need to move pruneExpiredTombstones to shared location if not already accessible\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bd cleanup --force` prunes expired tombstones after deleting closed issues\n- [ ] `bd cleanup --dry-run` shows what tombstones would be pruned\n- [ ] JSON output includes tombstone prune results","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-13T23:49:35.963356-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T02:19:57.237989-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T17:29:50.073906-08:00"}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1.

{"id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","title":"Update documentation for hash IDs and aliases","description":"Update all documentation to explain hash-based IDs and aliasing system.\n\n## Files to Update\n\n### 1. README.md\nAdd section explaining hash IDs:\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs\n\nBeads uses **hash-based IDs** for collision-free distributed issue tracking:\n\n- **Hash ID**: `bd-af78e9a2` (8-char SHA256 prefix, immutable, globally unique)\n- **Alias**: `#42` (sequential number, mutable, human-friendly)\n\n### Using IDs\n```bash\nbd show bd-af78e9a2   # Use hash ID\nbd show #42           # Use alias\nbd show 42            # Use alias (shorthand)\n```\n\n### Why Hash IDs?\n- **Collision-free**: Work offline without ID conflicts\n- **Distributed**: No coordination needed between clones\n- **Git-friendly**: Different IDs = different JSONL lines, fewer merge conflicts\n\n### Aliases\nAliases are workspace-local shortcuts for hash IDs. They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3. QUICKSTART.md (if exists)\nShow alias usage in examples:\n```bash\n# Create issue (gets hash ID + alias)\nbd create \"Fix authentication bug\" -p 1\n# → Created bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #1)\n\n# Reference by alias\nbd show #1\nbd update #1 --status in_progress\nbd close #1 --reason \"Fixed\"\n```\n\n### 4. ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5. MIGRATION.md (new file)\n```markdown\n# Migrating to Hash-Based IDs (v2.0)\n\n## Overview\nBeads v2.0 introduces hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems. This is a **breaking change** requiring migration.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Backup\n```bash\ncp -r .beads .beads.backup\ngit commit -am \"Pre-migration backup\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5. Resume normal work\n\n## Rollback\n```bash\n# Restore backup\nmv .beads.backup .beads\nbd export  # Regenerate JSONL\ngit checkout .beads/issues.jsonl\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I mix v1.x and v2.0 clones?**\nA: No. All clones must be on same version.\n\n**Q: Will my old issue IDs work?**\nA: No, but aliases preserve the numbers: bd-1c63eb84 → #1\n\n**Q: What happens to links like \"see bd-cb64c226.3\"?**\nA: Migration updates all text references automatically.\n```\n\n### 6. CHANGELOG.md\n```markdown\n## v2.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **Hash-based IDs**: Issues now use collision-free hash IDs (bd-af78e9a2)\n  instead of sequential IDs (bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda)\n- **Aliasing system**: Human-friendly aliases (#42) for hash IDs\n- **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate --hash-ids` to convert v1.x databases\n\n### Added\n- `bd alias` command for manual alias control\n- `bd migrate --hash-ids` migration tool\n- Alias conflict resolution (deterministic, content-hash ordering)\n\n### Removed\n- ID collision detection and resolution (~2,100 LOC)\n- `bd import --resolve-collisions` flag (no longer needed)\n\n### Benefits\n- ✅ Zero ID collisions in distributed workflows\n- ✅ Simpler codebase (-1,350 net LOC)\n- ✅ Better git merge behavior\n- ✅ True offline-first operation\n```\n\n## Testing\n- Build docs locally (if using doc generator)\n- Check all links work\n- Verify examples are correct\n- Spellcheck\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- README.md (hash ID section)\n- AGENTS.md (workflow updates)\n- ADVANCED.md (internals)\n- MIGRATION.md (new)\n- CHANGELOG.md (v2.0 entry)\n- docs/ (any other docs)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.979971-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981344-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981767-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.13","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.982167-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

{"id":"bd-9bsx","title":"Recurring dirty state after merge conflicts - bd sync keeps failing","description":"## Problem\n\n`bd sync` consistently fails with merge conflicts in `.beads/beads.jsonl`, creating a loop:\n1. User runs `bd sync`\n2. Git merge conflict occurs\n3. User resolves with `git checkout --theirs` (takes remote)\n4. Daemon auto-exports database state (which has local changes)\n5. JSONL becomes dirty again immediately\n6. Repeat\n\nThis has been happening for **weeks** and is extremely frustrating.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe recommended conflict resolution (`git checkout --theirs`) throws away local database state (comments, dependencies, closed issues). The daemon then immediately re-exports, creating a dirty state.\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nManual `bd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 git add \u0026\u0026 git commit \u0026\u0026 git push` after every failed sync.\n\n## Example Session\n\n```bash\n$ bd sync\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in .beads/beads.jsonl\n\n$ git checkout --theirs .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 bd import \u0026\u0026 git add \u0026\u0026 git commit \u0026\u0026 git push\n# Pushed successfully\n\n$ git status\nmodified: .beads/beads.jsonl  # DIRTY AGAIN!\n```\n\n## Lost Data in Recent Session\n\n- bd-ry1u closure (lost in merge)\n- Comments on bd-08fd, bd-23a8, bd-6049, bd-87a0 (lost)\n- Dependencies that existed only in local DB\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Use beads-merge tool** - Implement proper 3-way JSONL merge (bd-bzfy)\n2. **Smarter conflict resolution** - Detect when `--theirs` will lose data, warn user\n3. **Sync validation** - Check if JSONL == DB after merge, re-export if needed\n4. **Daemon awareness** - Pause auto-export during merge resolution\n5. **Transaction log** - Replay local changes after merge instead of losing them\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- bd-bzfy (beads-merge integration)\n- Possibly related to daemon auto-export behavior","notes":"## Solution Implemented\n\nFixed the recurring dirty state after merge conflicts by adding **sync validation** before re-exporting.\n\n### Root Cause\nLines 217-237 in `sync.go` unconditionally re-exported DB to JSONL after every import, even when they were already in sync. This created an infinite loop:\n1. User runs `bd sync` which pulls and imports remote JSONL\n2. Sync unconditionally re-exports DB (which has local changes)\n3. JSONL becomes dirty immediately\n4. Repeat\n\n### Fix\nAdded `dbNeedsExport()` function in `integrity.go` that checks:\n- If JSONL exists\n- If DB modification time is newer than JSONL\n- If DB and JSONL issue counts match\n\nNow `bd sync` only re-exports if DB actually has changes that differ from JSONL.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `dbNeedsExport()` in `cmd/bd/integrity.go` (lines 228-271)\n- Updated `sync.go` lines 217-251 to check before re-exporting\n- Added comprehensive tests in `cmd/bd/sync_merge_test.go`\n\n### Testing\nAll tests pass including 4 new tests:\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_InSync` - Verifies no export when synced\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_DBNewer` - Detects DB modifications\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_CountMismatch` - Catches divergence\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_NoJSONL` - Handles missing JSONL\n\nThis prevents the weeks-long frustration of merge conflicts causing infinite dirty loops.","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:52:14.776063-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00"}

Add new flags to `bd create`\n\n```go\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"body-file\", \"\", \"Read description from file (use - for stdin)\")\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"description-file\", \"\", \"Alias for --body-file\")\n```\n\n### 2. Flag precedence\n\n- If `--body-file` or `--description-file` is provided, read from file\n- If value is `-`, read from stdin\n- Otherwise fall back to `--body` or `--description` flag\n- If neither provided, description is empty (current behavior)\n\n### 3. Error handling\n\n- File doesn't exist → clear error message\n- File not readable → clear error message\n- stdin specified but not available → clear error message\n\n## Benefits\n\n✅ **Matches training data**: `gh issue create --body-file file.txt` is a common pattern\n✅ **No shell escaping issues**: File content is read directly\n✅ **Works with any content**: Markdown, special characters, quotes, etc.\n✅ **Agent-friendly**: Agents already write complex content to temp files\n✅ **User-friendly**: Easier for humans too when pasting long descriptions\n\n## Related Commands\n\nConsider adding similar support to:\n- `bd update --body-file` (for updating descriptions)\n- `bd comment --body-file` (if/when we add comments)\n\n## Examples\n\n```bash\n# From file\nbd create --title=\"Add new feature\" --body-file=feature.md\n\n# From stdin\necho \"Quick description\" | bd create --title=\"Bug fix\" --body-file=-\n\n# With other flags\nbd create \\\n  --title=\"Security issue\" \\\n  --type=bug \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --body-file=security-report.md \\\n  --label=security\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- Test with normal files\n- Test with stdin (`-`)\n- Test with non-existent files (error handling)\n- Test with binary files (should handle gracefully)\n- Test with empty files (valid - empty description)\n- Test that `--description-file` and `--body-file` are equivalent aliases","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-22T00:02:08.762684-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-22T00:02:08.762684-08:00"}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4.

One-time git scan cost, then fast again.\n\n### Size Estimates\n- ~80 bytes/entry\n- 7-day retention with 100 deletions/day = ~56KB\n- Git compressed: ~10KB\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Deletions propagate across clones\n- ✅ O(1) lookup (no git scan in normal case)\n- ✅ Works in shallow clones\n- ✅ Survives history rewrite\n- ✅ Audit trail (who deleted what when)\n- ✅ Self-healing via git fallback\n- ✅ Bounded size via time-based pruning\n\n## References\n- Investigation session: 2025-11-25\n- Related: bd-2q6d (stale database warnings)","status":"closed","issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:56:01.98027-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-25T16:36:27.965168-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-25T16:36:27.965168-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-qsm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.821911-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-x2i","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.851712-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-44e","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.88154-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-bhd","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.675787-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-bgs","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.744648-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-f0n","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.80649-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-v29","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.864569-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-mdw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:48.592492-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-03r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:54.295851-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Windows takes 30+ min without.\n\n## Current State\n\n- Windows jobs have continue-on-error: true (don't block PRs)\n- Tests timeout before completing, providing zero signal\n- RAM disk experiments added complexity without solving the problem\n\n## Solution: Smoke Tests Only\n\nReplace full test suite with minimal smoke tests that verify Windows compatibility in \u003c 2 minutes.\n\n### What to Test\n1. Binary builds - go build succeeds (already separate step)\n2. Binary executes - bd version works\n3. Init works - bd init creates valid database\n4. Basic CRUD - create, list, show, update, close\n5. Path handling - Windows backslash paths work\n\n### Proposed CI Change\n\nReplace test-windows-cmd and test-windows-internal with single smoke test job:\n- Build bd.exe\n- Run: bd version\n- Run: bd init --quiet --prefix smoke\n- Run: bd create --title \"Windows smoke test\" --type task\n- Run: bd list\n- Run: bd show smoke-001\n- Run: bd update smoke-001 --status in_progress\n- Run: bd close smoke-001\n\n### Benefits\n- Completes in \u003c 2 minutes vs 30+ minute timeouts\n- Provides actual pass/fail signal\n- Verifies Windows binary works\n- Removes RAM disk complexity\n- Single job instead of two parallel jobs\n\n### Files to Change\n- .github/workflows/ci.yml - Replace test-windows-cmd and test-windows-internal jobs\n\n### Migration Steps\n1. Remove test-windows-cmd job\n2. Remove test-windows-internal job\n3. Add single test-windows job with smoke tests\n4. Remove continue-on-error (tests should now pass reliably)\n5.

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6.

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:12:56.344193-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T01:05:56.141544-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T19:18:35.106895-07:00"}

These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2. List of repos grouped by git remote (same repository)\n3. Fix script or manual instructions for standardizing each repo\n4. Verification that after fixes, all clones of the same repo use the same JSONL filename\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Handle repos without metadata.json (use default discovery)\n- Handle repos with no git remote (standalone/local)\n- Handle repos that are not git repositories\n- Don't modify repos with uncommitted changes (warn instead)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All clones of the same git repository use the same JSONL filename\n- No duplicate JSONL files in any repo\n- All configurations documented in metadata.json\n- bd doctor passes on all repos","status":"open","issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00"}

TestThreeCloneCollision demonstrates this with reproducible failures.\n\n## Root Causes Identified\n1. Pairwise resolution doesn't scale - each clone makes local decisions without global context\n2. DetectCollisions modifies state during detection (line 83-86 in collision.go)\n3. No remapping history - can't track transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n4. Import-time resolution is too late - happens after git merge\n\n## Solution Architecture\nReplace pairwise resolution with deterministic global N-way resolution using:\n- Content-addressable identity (content hashing)\n- Global collision resolution (sort all versions by hash)\n- Read-only detection phase (separate from modification)\n- Idempotent imports (content-first matching)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes without skipping\n- All clones converge to identical content after final pull\n- No data loss (all issues present in all clones)\n- Works for N workers (test with 5+ clones)\n- Idempotent imports (importing same JSONL multiple times is safe)\n\n## Implementation Phases\nSee child issues for detailed breakdown of each phase.","status":"closed","issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.889079-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T11:59:41.031668-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T11:59:41.031668-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-khnb","title":"bd migrate --update-repo-id triggers auto-import that resurrects deleted issues","description":"**Bug:** Running `bd migrate --update-repo-id` can resurrect previously deleted issues from git history.\n\n## What Happened\n\nUser deleted 490 closed issues:\n- Deletion committed successfully (06d655a) with JSONL at 48 lines\n- Database had 48 issues after deletion\n- User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id` to fix legacy database\n- Migration triggered daemon auto-import\n- JSONL had been restored to 538 issues (from commit 6cd3a32 - before deletion)\n- Auto-import loaded the old JSONL over the cleaned database\n- Result: 490 deleted issues resurrected\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe auto-import logic in `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136`:\n```go\nif isJSONLNewer(jsonlPath) {\n    fmt.Println(\"→ JSONL is newer than database, importing first...\")\n    if err := importFromJSONL(ctx, jsonlPath, renameOnImport); err != nil {\n```\n\nThis checks if JSONL mtime is newer than database and auto-imports. The problem:\n1. Git operations (pull, merge, checkout) can restore old JSONL files\n2. Restored file has recent mtime (time of git operation)\n3. Auto-import sees \"newer\" JSONL and imports it\n4. Old data overwrites current database state\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 19:59: Commit 6cd3a32 restored JSONL to 538 issues from d99222d\n- 20:22: Commit 3520321 (bd sync)\n- 20:23: Commit 06d655a deleted 490 issues → JSONL now 48 lines\n- 20:23: User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id`\n- Migration completed, daemon started\n- Daemon saw JSONL (restored earlier to 538) was \"newer\" than database\n- Auto-import resurrected 490 deleted issues\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss bug** - user deletions can be undone silently\n- Affects any workflow that uses git branches, merges, or checkouts\n- Auto-import has no safety checks against importing older data\n- Users have no warning that old data will overwrite current state\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. **Content-based staleness** (not mtime-based)\n   - Compare JSONL content hash vs database content hash\n   - Only import if content actually changed\n   - Prevents re-importing old data with new mtime\n\n2. **Database timestamp check**\n   - Store \"last export timestamp\" in database metadata\n   - Only import JSONL if it's newer than last export\n   - Prevents importing old JSONL after git operations\n\n3. **User confirmation**\n   - Before auto-import, show diff of what will change\n   - Require confirmation for large changes (\u003e10% issues affected)\n   - Safety valve for destructive imports\n\n4. **Explicit sync mode**\n   - Disable auto-import entirely\n   - Require explicit `bd sync` or `bd import` commands\n   - Trade convenience for safety\n\n## Recommended Solution\n\nCombination of #1 and #2:\n- Add `last_export_timestamp` to database metadata\n- Check JSONL mtime \u003e last_export_timestamp before importing\n- Add content hash check as additional safety\n- Show warning if importing would delete \u003e10 issues\n\nThis preserves auto-import convenience while preventing data loss.\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136` - Auto-import logic\n- `cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go` - Daemon export/import cycle\n- `internal/autoimport/autoimport.go` - Staleness detection\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create and delete some issues, commit to git\n2. Checkout an earlier commit (before deletion)\n3. Checkout back to current commit\n4. JSONL file now has recent mtime but old content\n5. Run any bd command that triggers auto-import\n6.

Fix checkVersionMismatch to not claim 'will upgrade' unless probe passes\n3. Only update bd_version after successful migration probe\n4. Add schema verification before import operations\n5.

Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267736-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00"}

When there's a repo ID mismatch (e.g., database from a different clone or after remote URL change), this can incorrectly treat local issues as deleted because they don't exist in the remote's git history.\n\n**Fix Applied:** Added safety guard at lines 971-987 in importer.go that:\n- Checks issue status before deletion via git-history-backfill\n- Prevents deletion of open/in_progress issues\n- Provides clear warning with actionable steps\n- Suggests using --no-git-history flag or bd delete for explicit deletion\n\n## Root Cause 2: Daemon sync race condition overwrites local unpushed changes\n\n**Location:** cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go, performAutoImport()\n\nThe daemon sync's auto-import function pulls from remote without checking for uncommitted local changes. This can overwrite local work that hasn't been pushed yet.\n\n**Fix Applied:** Added warning at lines 565-575 in daemon_sync.go that:\n- Checks for uncommitted changes before pulling\n- Warns user about potential overwrite\n- Suggests running 'bd sync' to commit/push first\n- Continues with pull but user is informed\n\n## Additional Safety Improvements\n\n1. Enhanced repo ID mismatch error message (daemon_sync.go:362-371)\n   - Added warning about deletion risk\n   - Clarified that mismatch can cause incorrect deletions\n\n2. Safety guard in deletions manifest processing (importer.go:886-902)\n   - Prevents deletion of open/in_progress issues in deletions.jsonl\n   - Provides diagnostic information\n   - Suggests recovery options\n\n3. Updated tests (purge_test.go)\n   - Changed test to use closed issue (safe to delete)\n   - Verifies safety guard works correctly\n\n## Testing\n\nAll tests pass:\n- go test ./internal/importer/... ✓\n- go build ./cmd/bd/ ✓\n\nThe safety guards now prevent both root causes from deleting active work.","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-14T23:00:19.36203-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T23:07:43.311616-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T23:07:43.311616-08:00"}

Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4.

Multiple `bd daemon` processes can start in same workspace.\n\nExpected: One daemon per workspace (each workspace = separate .beads/ dir with bd.sock)\nActual: Multiple daemons can run simultaneously in same workspace\n\nNote: Separate git clones = separate workspaces = separate daemons (correct). Git worktrees share .beads/ and have known limitations (documented, use --no-daemon).","notes":"## Fix Summary\n\nSuccessfully prevented the nested .beads/.beads/ recursion bug by implementing two safeguards:\n\n1. **Path Canonicalization in FindDatabasePath()** (beads.go):\n   - Added filepath.Abs() + filepath.EvalSymlinks() to normalize all database paths\n   - Prevents relative path edge cases that create nested directories\n   - Ensures all daemons see the same canonical path\n\n2. **Nested Directory Detection** (daemon_lifecycle.go):\n   - Added explicit check for \".beads/.beads\" pattern in setupDaemonLock()\n   - Fails fast with clear error message if nested structure detected\n   - Provides user hints about proper usage\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe daemon lock (added Oct 22, 2025) correctly prevents simultaneous daemons in the SAME workspace. However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1. Second daemon start fails with \"daemon already running\" error\n✅ 2. Killing daemon releases lock, new daemon can start  \n✅ 3. No infinite .beads/ recursion possible (tested nested BEADS_DB path)\n✅ 4.

In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T17:08:52.043475-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T17:08:52.043477-08:00"}

The actual problem was:\n\n**Import/Export hanging when daemon is running** due to SQLite lock contention:\n\n1. When daemon is connected, `PersistentPreRun` in main.go returns early without initializing the `store` variable\n2. Import/Export commands then tried to open the database directly with `sqlite.New(dbPath)` \n3. This blocked waiting for the database lock that the daemon already holds → **HANGS INDEFINITELY**\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nModified both import.go and export.go to:\n1. Detect when `daemonClient` is connected\n2. Explicitly close the daemon connection before opening direct SQLite access\n3. Added debug logging to help diagnose similar issues\n\nThis ensures import/export commands always run in direct mode, avoiding lock contention.\n\n## File Path Handling\n\nThe file path confusion (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl) was a red herring.
